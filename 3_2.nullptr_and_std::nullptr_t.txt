C++11 lets you use nulptr instead of 0 or NULL to specify that a  pointer refers
to no value (which differs from having an underfined value). This new feature
especially helps to avoid mistakes that orrurred when a null pointer was
interpreted as an integral value.For examples:

void f(int);
void f(void*);
f(0);       //calls f(int)
f(NULL);    //calls f(int) if NULL is 0,ambiguous otherwise
f(nullptr); //calls f(void*)
